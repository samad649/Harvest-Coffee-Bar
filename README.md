Summary: Yesterday, everyone started planning out our plan to tackle the rest of our sprint goals and began working on their most important assigned story tasks. Today, everyone is finishing up the most important assigned story tasks. The biggest roadblock is going to be our limited time before the sprint is due and learning how to work with the new backend framework along with the new environment setting.
